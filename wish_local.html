        <h2>Wish Local stores were having a hard time managing Wish inventory in their store</h2>
        <p>The <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid currentColor;"><a href="https://www.wishlocal.com/" target="_blank">Wish Local</a></span> program enables brick and mortar stores to be pickup locations for <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid currentColor;"><a href="https://www.wish.com/" target="_blank">Wish</a></span> orders. Launched around 2.5 years ago as an experimental initiative, the program today has over 60k+ store partners. Stores use the Wish Local app to track and manage Wish orders, and process customer pickups.</p>
        <p>The app showed a plain vanilla list of all Wish orders which did not meet the needs of the stores. Our customer support requests showed that it was painful for stores to manage a large number of Wish orders.</p>

      <section class="proj-sec" style="padding-bottom: 100px;padding-top: 60px;">
        <p>The team wanted to launch a program which would result in stores receiving even more Wish inventory. However, before we launch this program, we knew that first we had to thoughtfully design the inventory management UX in the app so that we do not exacerbate the current problems that stores were having with managing inventory.</p>

        <h2>One month to craft a helpful inventory management UX</h2>
        <p>Our goal for the project was to craft an experience that would help stores effectively manage Wish inventory in their physical location using the Wish Local app. Our high level goals were to:</p>
        <ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>Make it easier for <strong>all</strong> stores (big and small, at all locations worldwide) to manage Wish inventory</li>
          <li>Be proactive – anticipate store needs and provide help before stores have to ask for it</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>My role</h2>
        <p>I was the sole designer for this project and worked on the project between May–June 2021 (end-to-end).</p>
        <p>I worked alongside a UX Writer and a Product Manager. In addition, I also consulted with a UX Researcher to get feedback on my Interview Protocol. Lastly, I collaborated closely with developers during the development phase to ensure quality implementation.</p>
        <p>The project was launched on November 1, 2021.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the ambiguous problem space</h2>
        <p>The problem space for this project was large and ambiguous – we knew that managing inventory is painful for stores, but that was it. There were no specific insights or goals for the inventory management experience. To understand the exact problems stores are facing, we conducted user interviews.</p>
        <p>I consulted with our User Researcher on our research plan. We interviewed 9 power stores (5 in US, 4 in Mexico) over video conferencing. Our goals were to uncover the problems stores were facing with managing inventory, understand how stores were organizing inventory in their physical location, and factors that influenced how they managed inventory.</p>

        <h2>Who, When, Where</h2>
        <p>In addition to gaining relevant insights which helped the team align on goals, conducting interviews helped me develop empathy. I deeply understood our users and their context. I created a storyboard using our existing illustration library to put myself and stakeholders in users shoes. I used this story during design crits to quickly set context before presenting my designs.</p>

        <p>I created a storyboard using our existing illustration library to put myself and stakeholders in users shoes. I used this story during design crits to quickly set context before presenting my designs. The storyboard included insights we got from interviews, for example, showing the scale of items stores have to handle, how busy the storeowner is while processing a pickup, how the customer might also be in a rush, how stores organise Wish inventory in their stores for quick pickup etc.</p>

        <h2>How stores organize Wish inventory in their physical location</h2>
        <p>Here were some insights we got:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>Stores did not have guidance or best practices around how to best organize inventory in their physical location</li>
          <li>As a result, stores had self invented ways of making small bundles of inventory for a quick pickup process</li>
          <li>One store mentioned they tour nearby stores to see how they are organising inventory</li>
          <li>Most common organization method found: Separate "Ready for Pickup" and "Listed for sale" items, and organize "Ready for pickup" items in smaller bundles based on first letter of package code.</li>

        <h2>Stores want to provide a quick, easy and smooth pickup experience to customers. How they manage inventory aligns around this.</h2>
        <p>I used this critical insight to deeply think through how can we design the inventory management experience. Writing down my thoughts helps me break down problems. Below are some snippets from my FigJam document showing my thinking:</p>

        <h2>How might we bridge the gap between physical and digital? How might we guide stores along their journey of managing inventory?</h2>
        <p>Our hypothesis was that stores will benefit if the inventory management experience in the app was similar to how they managed inventory in their physical location. Below are some interview insights that informed our hypothesis: </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <li>Ability to sort items in app alphabetically:</li>
          <p style="color: #727272; padding-top: 0;">"I organize items that are ready for pickup in my store alphabetically. Thus, I would like to be able to sort items in my app alphabetically"</p>
          <li>If any item activity happened in app, stores would like to take action on the item in their physical location too:</li>
          <p style="color: #727272; padding-top: 0;">"When an item doesn't get picked up and gets relisted for sale, I would like to know when that happens so I can move that item in my store to its correct location"</p>

        <p><strong>The Data Editor has now become a core component of Postman and is being used by more than 10 million developers worldwide</strong> which fills me with happiness and satisfaction. Every time I see a user attach a screenshot of the Data Editor on GitHub to provide feedback, I zoom in to understand how they’re using it. The editor has also been extended to support ANY kind of data manipulation (and not just key value pairs), and is now being extended to support editing nested data (for example, JSON) amongst many other things.
          <br><br>Exciting times!</p>
